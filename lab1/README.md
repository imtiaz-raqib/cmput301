# **LAB 1**
----------
 
This lab was an introduction to Git and GitHub

We learnt how to
- Make a GitHub account
- Create a repository
- Make changes to the repository
- Add, commit and push the changes to the repository so they are uploaded to GitHub

**Lab Participation Exercise (Java, OOP)**

We were supposed to add three new model classes to LonelyTwitter:
- The first should be an abstract base class which represents the current mood. 
- The second and third should be non-abstract classes which represent different moods and inherit from the abstract class. 

1. Each mood should have a date and getters and setters to access the date. 
2. A constructor which sets the date to a default and 
3. A constructor which takes a date as an argument should be provided.  

Encapuslation should be followed. Each mood should also have a mood-dependent format method which returns a string representing the mood.

Our new code should have examples of: classes, methods, attributes, access modifiers, encapsulation, constructors, inheritance and abstract base classes.

This was implemented to the forked LonelyTwitter repo
