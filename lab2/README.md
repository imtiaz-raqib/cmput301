# **LAB 2**
----------

In this lab, we used Google's GSON library for serilization and deserilization of the LonelyTwitter classes.

[Click here](https://github.com/imtiazraqib/lonelyTwitter/commit/f165a26d130a4c77b00bd875cd51f44a570372aa) to see the implementation of Google GSON that we did in the lab to two methods, `saveInFile` and `loadInFile`

----------

**Lab Participation Exercise (Java I/O and GSON)**

Our modifications to LonelyTwitter should include GSON serialization/deserialization of your LonelyTweetModel classes, and automatically updating the listview by calling notifydatasetchanged()!

For the lab assignment we were supposed to implement the clear button so that when the clear button is clicked, both the tweets on the screen are cleared and the tweets on the disk are also removed.
