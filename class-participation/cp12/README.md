# Class Participation Exercise 12

Consider a Rect class to represent a rectangle in a two-dimensional integer plane.


`public class Rect {`
    `...`
    `// create rectangle with given corners`
    `public Rect( Point topLeft, Point botRight ) { ... }`

    `// return true iff point p is in or on this rectangle`
    `public boolean encloses( Point p ) { ... }`
`}`


Depict a thorough set of test case equivalence classes for the encloses method, also indicating the expected results. Add explanatory text as needed for analogous or unusual cases. State any assumptions.
