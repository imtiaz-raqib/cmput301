#Class Participation Exercise 8

Proper completion of this exercise is considered as part of course participation. An answer will be discussed in class.

Working in pairs, consider a function to return the index of a given integer x within the first n integers in a given sorted array a. If x is not found, the function returns -1.

Do the following in sequence.

- First, as a comment in your code, note who your partner is.

- Second, declare an appropriate signature for this function in Java. (Make it easy to use.)

- Don't implement the function yet. (Yes, really.)

- Third, write Java code to call and test this function. (Was the function easy to use?)

- Finally, write a binary search implementation for this function. (Does it pass the tests?).
