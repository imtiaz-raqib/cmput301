#Class Participation Exercise 11

Proper completion of this exercise is considered as part of course participation. An answer will be discussed in class.

Model the following behavior using a correct UML state diagram.

I want to keep my flamethrower in a vault that's hard to find.

So, to reveal the lock to the vault, I have to remove a helmet from a shelf. This will reveal the lock only while a door is closed.

Once I can see the lock, I can insert my key to open the vault.

For extra security, I make sure that I can open the vault only if I put the helmet back on the shelf.

If an intruder forgets this precaution, a facehugger will be unleashed to disable the intruder.
